        <p>HoloLens is the world's first self-contained holographic computer.</p>

        <p>I prototyped new interactions, built immersive experiences, and provided feedback for pre-release SDKs.</p>

        <p>During this time I had the opportunity to give some of the first public demos of the device during our launch
            announcement at Build 2015. The following year I
            mentored attendees at our holographic academy sessions. During these sessions we would guide programmers
            through their first end-to-end project, culminating in a group multiplayer holographic experience.</p>
